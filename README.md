# Minecraft <-> Discord Factions Bot

A robust, full-featured Discord bot designed specifically for Minecraft Factions servers. Xenon connects Discord users to their in-game counterparts and provides powerful moderation, faction management, alerts, and automation tools.

This was originally developed as a private project intended for client distribution, which is why MongoDB-based authorization was implemented to control access.
